Despite agriculture being the backbone of Uganda, most farmers are found to limitedly rely on technology. This is attributed to a few of them having access to the desired technology and even where its available, a few know how to use it. This also makes lack of training a crucial factor as far as agricultural technology is concerned (Mirembe, Lubega, Nambogo, & Namagembe, 2023).
Farming technology has previously been highlighted as being crucial if proper crop management and better yields are to be achieved in Africa. More so, African farmers are seemingly ready to absorb this farm related technology. However, this technology is relatively scarce and in some instances none existent (Antonio, Carlos, André, & Pedro, 2020). 
This study project is going to focus on building a high end integrative farming journal application that seeks to capture plant growth traits, health data and project output in tomato open-field and green house systems. This application will help the farmer be able to track plant traits right from the beginning of their projects and in turn be able to use the application to expand on their outputs across several projects as performance data will be captured using the system and data science methods applied for better analysis.
